# PaintApp

# Overview

In order to get familiar with C# and Visual Studio, I decided to create this basic painting app that really allows to see what is possible!  

Below is a link to my YouTube demonstration. It's a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code:

# Development Environment

HP Laptop (I tried to do this on my Mac, but couldn't)
Visual Studio
C#

# Useful Websites

List of websites that were helpful:

- [A Tour of C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/)

# Future Work

List of things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future:

- Complete the Save function of the app.  For some reason the code in the tutorial wasn't working
- Add more buttons for different shapes
- Not sure if possible, but would be cool to add some nice background music
